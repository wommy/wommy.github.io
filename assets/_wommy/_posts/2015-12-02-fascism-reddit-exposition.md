top comment says to check out this link:
<http://www.thenation.com/article/inverted-totalitarianism/>

the title is familiar, i remember this wikipedia article i read two years ago:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_totalitarianism>

before we get too far, i thought a definition of fascism would be helpful/beneficial:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism>
