so i just fuckin typed this
and fuckin <prose.io> wasnt in sync for whatever reason
so heres round 2

## workflow

since 2015/3 ive been working with **Static Site Generators**

<mixture.io> was my introduction. i built <wommytilliams.com> in it, over probably 6 weeks. it was soon depreciated after that tho, which is when i pivoted to [jekyll](jekyllrb.com). 

jekyll was a no-brainer; i was reading about it and knew it must be the next thing i learned. where mixture was packaged mac application, jekyll introduced alot of command line play, which at the time, was very overwhelming.

i took it in stride and built a few demo sites to familiarize myself with its capabilites.
